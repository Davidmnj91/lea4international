    "description": "My name is Lucia Soto, I am the founder and Managing Director of LEA 4 International. I found this company inspired by the many experiences I had abroad and how they enriched my life. My first experience abroad was under the Erasmus program. During my university studies I had the opportunity to be an Erasmus student for a year at the Faculty of Law at La Sapienza University in Rome, it was a wonderful experience that taught me that the essence of the Erasmus program is much deeper than the fact of studying in a different country and learning a new language. It is also about the bonds that you create with people when you are out of your comfort zone, the tolerance you develop towards people from other cultures and the openness for new challenges that you acquire. Erasmus was just the beginning for me, now I can say that I have lived in several countries and that I have met people from all around the world. My previous professional experience working as a project coordinator for Erasmus+ projects has taught me the necessary learning tools for the successful implementation of these types of projects. My main goal for my company is to promote the importance of education globally, to encourage people, especially young students, to get out of their comfort zone and explore what is outside, and to help them have memorable life experiences abroad while at the same time contributing to improve education and understanding across cultures.",
