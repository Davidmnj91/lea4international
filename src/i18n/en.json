A couple of years after that I decided that I wanted to explore another country outside of Europe so I decided to do an exchange program in the United States, and again it was an unforgettable experience for me. I became an Au Pair and lived with a host family for a year and a half in New York, this allowed me to gain practical knowledge of the educational system in the United States, it also allowed me to meet people from all round the world. <br></br> <br></br> My goal is to encourage students to get out of their comfort zone and to help people having memorable life experiences abroad while at the same time contributing to improving education and understanding across cultures.",
